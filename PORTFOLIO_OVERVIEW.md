---

### 2. âš¡ Operational Metrics
**Purpose:** Track key operational efficiency indicators beyond emissions

**Key Features:**
- PUE (Power Usage Effectiveness) trends - industry benchmark: 1.08-1.10
- Carbon-Free Energy (CFE) hourly matching progress (66% in 2024)

- Year-over-year improvement calculations
- Cost savings from efficiency gains

**Interview Talking Points:**
- "I tracked operational metrics that directly drive emissions - PUE, CFE, water, waste"
- "Used actual facility-level data from environmental reports where available"
- "Calculated financial impact: PUE improvement of 0.01 saved ~$X million annually"
- "CFE is hourly matching, which is harder than 100% annual renewable claims"

---

### 3. ðŸ”¬ Scope Analysis
**Purpose:** GHG Protocol-compliant emissions breakdown

**Key Features:**
- Scope 1, 2, 3 breakdown (5%, 20%, 75% respectively)
- Scope 3 category analysis (15 categories per GHG Protocol)
- Waterfall charts showing emissions flow
- Science-Based Target (SBTi) tracking
- Pareto analysis for prioritization

**Technical Highlights:**

- SBTi alignment (50% Scope 1&2, 30% Scope 3 by 2030)

**Interview Talking Points:**
- "Implemented GHG Protocol standards - the global framework for emissions accounting"
- "Scope 3 is 75% of total emissions, typical for tech companies"
- "Tracked progress toward Science-Based Targets validated by SBTi"

### 4. ðŸ¤– ML Forecasting
**Purpose:** Predictive analytics for emissions and operational metrics

**Key Features:**
- Three forecasting models: Prophet, ARIMA/SARIMA, Holt-Winters
- Scenario analysis: Business-as-usual, Aggressive Decarbonization, Efficiency Focus
- Forecast 6-60 months into future
- Model diagnostics (MAE, RMSE, MAPE, AIC, BIC)
- Forecast both emissions AND operational metrics (PUE, CFE, water, waste)

**Technical Highlights:**
- Prophet: Facebook's robust time series algorithm
- ARIMA: Classical statistical forecasting with manual parameter tuning
- Holt-Winters: Exponential smoothing with seasonality
- Scenario modeling with adjustable reduction assumptions

**Interview Talking Points:**
- "Implemented three complementary forecasting approaches"
- "ARIMA with statsmodels - shows understanding of statistical theory, not just library usage"
- "Users can tune ARIMA parameters (p,d,q) and compare models using AIC/BIC"
- "Scenario analysis models different decarbonization strategies: 15-20% reduction pathways"
- "Forecast operational metrics like PUE improvement trajectory to 2030"

**Why Not Auto-ARIMA:**
- "pmdarima had binary compatibility issues, so I implemented manual ARIMA with statsmodels"
- "This actually demonstrates deeper understanding - users can experiment with parameters"
- "Shows ability to work around library issues rather than being dependent on black-box solutions"

- Portfolio optimization with budget constraints
- Implementation timelines and cumulative impact

**Technical Highlights:**

**Interview Talking Points:**
- "Built 5 different financial models for decarbonization strategies"
- "Historical ROI uses actual 2020-2024 improvements with industry-standard cost estimates"
- "MACC prioritizes initiatives by cost-effectiveness ($/tonne COâ‚‚e reduced)"
- "Shows business case: PUE improvements have 2-3 year payback"
- "Renewable PPAs break-even at ~$45/tonne carbon price (below current EU ETS)"

## Data Methodology

### Data Sources
**Real Data (from environmental reports):**
- âœ… Annual emissions by scope (2020-2024)
- âœ… Facility-level PUE ratings (27 data centers)
- âœ… Facility-level water consumption (27 data centers)
- âœ… Regional CFE percentages
- âœ… Waste generation and diversion rates
- âœ… Energy consumption totals

**Estimated/Interpolated:**
- ðŸŸ¡ Monthly disaggregation (from annual totals)
- ðŸŸ¡ Facilities not listed in reports (proportional allocation)
- ðŸŸ¡ Cost estimates (using market rates: $70/MWh, $50/tonne COâ‚‚e)

**Methodology Notes:**
- Companies publish annual aggregates, not monthly facility-level data
- Monthly allocation uses linear interpolation to smooth year-to-year transitions
- All assumptions clearly documented in code and UI
- No fabricated training data or false benchmarks

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Limited Data
**Problem:** Companies only publish annual aggregates, not monthly facility-level data  
**Solution:** Linear interpolation for smooth time series, proportional allocation for facilities  
**Learning:** Working with real-world data constraints, not perfect datasets

### Challenge 2: Circular Logic in Driver Analysis
**Problem:** "Electricity drives emissions" is circular - emissions ARE from electricity  
**Solution:** Removed driver analysis, focused on operational efficiency predictors instead  
**Learning:** Critical thinking about what analysis actually provides value

### Challenge 3: Library Compatibility (pmdarima)
**Problem:** NumPy version incompatibility prevented auto-ARIMA  
**Solution:** Implemented manual ARIMA with statsmodels, user-tunable parameters  
**Learning:** Work around library issues, sometimes constraints lead to better solutions

### Challenge 4: Year-End Data Jumps
